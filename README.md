## Idea

* A menu backed by a simple Google Sheet - [menu.rocks Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14jM5bSRLCIrDoGZcManYHUNqhQTogvbnH3A70F_OrHs/edit?usp=sharing)
* Available online (mobile friendly) at an easily rememberable URL - e.g. menu.rocks/reidys
* Printable on A4 pages to be used in-house
* Printable QR codes also available
* Once set up, edits can easily be made on Google Sheet


## Development

**Run**
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

**Build**

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
